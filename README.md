I've been working on a project that combines the power of OpenAI's DALL·E and OpenAI's 'text-davinci-003' 🤖🎉

Introducing an innovative solution for those times when you have a handful of leftover ingredients and you're wondering what delicious dish you can whip up with them. 🍽️💡 Our Autogenerative AI, powered by OpenAI and DALL·E, can now generate recipes based on those ingredients and even provide stunning images of the dishes!

With DALL·E's remarkable image generation capabilities and OpenAI's cutting-edge Autogenerative AI, I created a script that generates innovative recipes and provides visual representations of the dishes.
